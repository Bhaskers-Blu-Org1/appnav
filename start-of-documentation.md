# IBM Application Navigator

IBM Application Navigator is a tool that extends the KubernetesÂ® console to provide display, inspection, understanding and expose day 2 operations of applications comprised of Kubernetes resources and existing middleware, such as WebSphere Application Server. App Navigator extends the open source [Kubernetes Application Navigator (kAppNav)](https://kappnav.io) by providing integration with WebSphere ND Cells and Liberty Collectives, enabling visibility to both existing and containerized applications.
