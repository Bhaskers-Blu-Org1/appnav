# IBM Application Navigator

IBM Application Navigator is a tool that extends the Kubernetes&reg; console to provide the display, inspection, understanding, and
navigation of applications composed of Kubernetes resources and existing middleware, such as WebSphere Application Server.
Application Navigator extends the open source [Kubernetes Application Navigator (kAppNav)](http://kappnav.io) by providing integration to
WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cells and Liberty collectives, which enables visibility to existing and containerized applications.
