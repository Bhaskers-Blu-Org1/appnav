# IBM Application Navigator

IBM Application Navigator is a tool that extends the KubernetesÂ® console to provide display, inspection, understanding, and
navigation of applications comprised of Kubernetes resources and existing middleware, such as WebSphere Application Server.
AppNav extends the open source [Kubernetes Application Navigator (kAppNav)](http://kappnav.io) by providing integration to
WebSphere ND Cells and Liberty Collectives, enabling visibility to existing and containerized applications.
