# IBM Application Navigator overview

IBM Application Navigator is designed to satisfy a need for application operators to focus on containerized applications instead of the infrastructure view that the Kubernetes platform consoles provide. This IBM design yields a superior user experience for applications that dramatically surpasses the infrastructure view. For more information, see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application.

Using IBM Application Navigator, you can visually navigate to the respective components of the applications. Each component is a Kubernetes resource, such as a deployment or service resource, and has a **Kind**. IBM Application Navigator provides action menu items by **Kind**. These menu items provide URLs and scriptable commands that enable the navigation to, and operation of, other tools in context for the selected component.
